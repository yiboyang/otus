This directory contains the core utility functions called by the experiment and plotting notebooks.

Below we list a summary of the files and the functions within them.

----------------------------------------------
LorentzVector.py:
    Class of functions related to calculating properties of Lorentz 4-vectors.

configs.py:
    This file sets a series of global configuration settings relevant to training the models.

func_utils.py
    This file defines a myriad of utility functions used in both the experiment and plotting notebooks.

models.py
    This file defines the network architecture models used in the experiments.

plot_utils.py
    This file defines a myriad of plotting specific functions used in both the experiment and plotting notebooks.

ppttbar_utils.py
    This file defines functions used in the ppttbar experiment notebook.
    
ppzee_utils.py
    This file defines functions used in the ppzee experiment notebook.

split_hdf5data.py
    Preprocesses the .hdf5 data to split it into trainin, validation, and testing fractions.
