# 
This is the first step of generating data. 

The code found here runs the simulation chain (MG+Pythia+Delphes) and produces the files to be processed by the next steps.

STEP 0:
If not already done generate the MG process.

The process to generate is p p > t t~ with a specific final state. The command sequence is 
$ ./bin/mg5_aMC
MG5_aMC> generate p p > t t~, (t~ > b~ w-, w- > e- ve~),(t > b w+, w+ > u d~)
MG5_aMC> output ppttbar_2

Then move the directory to the directory where all the data will be generated:
$ mv ppttbar_2 /pub/jnhoward/FastSim/ppttbarData/MGData2/

STEP 1:
(Start here if the ppttbar_2 directory exists)

Here is the relevant code:
  - init.sh 
    Loads the path to Delphes library

  - <run number>_<number of events generated>_ppttbar.txt   Ex. 3_600k_ppttbar.txt
    Correct settings for simulation run

  - process<run number>.sh Ex. process3.sh
    Launches simulation with correct settings

  - serial<run number>.sh  Ex. serial3.sh
    Launches process and pipes output to log file, for running on cluster

Create <run number>_<number of events generated>_ppttbar.txt, process<run number>.sh, and serial<run number>.sh for your run number and events generated. Change files as appropriate.

STEP 2:
Submit to cluster. Note that this step takes the longest.

$ qsub -ckpt blcr serial<run number>.sh

EXTRA:
  - countNumJets.C
    Counts number of 4-jet events and gives histogram of distribution of nJets over all events. See comments in code for how to run.
