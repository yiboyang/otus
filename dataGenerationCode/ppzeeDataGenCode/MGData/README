# 
This is the first step of generating data. 

The code found here runs the simulation chain (MG+Pythia+Delphes) and produces the files to be processed by the next steps.

STEP 0:
If not already done generate the MG process.

The process to generate is p p > Z > e+ e-. The command sequence is
$ ./bin/mg5_aMC
MG5_aMC> generate p p > Z > e+ e-
MG5_aMC> output ppzee

Then move the directory to the directory where all the data will be generated:
$ mv ppzee /pub/jnhoward/FastSim/ppzeeData/MGData/

STEP 1:
(Start here if ppzee directory exists)

Here is the relevant code:
  - init.sh 
    Loads the path to Delphes library

  - <run number>_<number of events generated>_ppzee.txt   Ex. 3_600k_ppzee.txt
    Correct settings for simulation run

  - process<run number>.sh Ex. process3.sh
    Launches simulation with correct settings

  - serial<run number>.sh  Ex. serial3.sh
    Launches process and pipes output to log file, for running on cluster

Create <run number>_<number of events generated>_ppzee.txt, process<run number>.sh, and serial<run number>.sh for your run number and events generated. Change files as appropriate.

STEP 2:
Submit to cluster. Note that this step takes the longest.

$ qsub -ckpt blcr serial<run number>.sh
