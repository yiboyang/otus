This directory contains the code necessary to create hdf5 files of the latent data

Directories that were used as tests to create this code or are not directly relevant are
__pycache__

The code LHEtoHDF5.py converts LHE files to HDF5 format.

ppzee_runLHEtoHDF5.py runs LHEtoHDF5.py on a given file.

ppzee_runLHEtoHDF5.sh runs ppzee_runLHEtoHDF5.py on all relevant LHE files.

HDF5Data/ is where the data is stored.

To run the code ppzee_runLHEtoHDF5.sh over the cluster:
$ qsub -ckpt blcr serial.sh
